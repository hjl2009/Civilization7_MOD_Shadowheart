[h1]Shadowheart Dual Leaders Mod[/h1]

This mod offers two new leaders inspired by Shadowheart from Baldur’s Gate 3 — the Moon Redeemed and the Dark Justiciar — each representing a different choice she makes when confronting the Nightsong.

Also provided 2 mementos: [b]Night Spear[/b] and [b]Night Orchid[/b].

Special thanks to [b]MAO[/b] for providing the [b]2D Leader Framework[/b] and [b]Commander Overhaul[/b] and [b]Maple_Leaves[/b] for providing [b]Mod Unit Portraits Fix[/b] mod support — these frameworks made creating custom leader visuals and mechanics far more accessible.

[h2]Mod Overview[/h2]

This mod adds two distinct leaders to Civilization VII, each derived from Shadowheart’s divergent choices during the Nightsong trial, leading to very different paths of belief and strategy.

[h2]Shadowheart, Moon Redeemed[/h2]

Shadowheart originally served Shar as a cleric, but at a pivotal moment she refused to slay the Nightsong and chose mercy and hope instead. Having abandoned the bonds of darkness, she rediscovered her memory and sense of self beneath the moonlight and became chosen by Selûne, guiding others with the power of light.

[h2]Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar[/h2]

Before facing the Trial of Shadows, Shadowheart chose to silence the voice of light and personally slay the Nightsong, offering this act in devotion to Shar. She was fully accepted as Shar’s chosen — the Dark Justiciar — and wields unrelenting power to judge the world in shadow.
